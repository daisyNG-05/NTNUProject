# NTNUProject
Project Purpose Explanation: The project appears to analyze user engagement and behavior on an e-commerce platform. It involves processing raw event data related to user interactions such as viewing items, adding items to the cart, adding items to the wishlist, and making purchases. The ultimate goal is to create a predictive model using logistic regression to estimate the probability of a user making a purchase based on their interactions and behavior on the platform. The calculated probability is used for reporting and ranking users by their likelihood to make a purchase.
